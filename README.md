# IoT-Based-Real-Time-Temperature-Humidity-Monitoring-System
I developed an IoT-based embedded system designed to monitor environmental conditions—specifically temperature and humidity—in real-time. The core of the system is a Raspberry Pi (Model 3/4) which acts as the central processing unit.  The system interfaces with a DHT11 sensor to capture temperature and humidity data every 2 seconds.
